									<a href="https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/trends/WPP2010/WPP2010_Volume-I_Comprehensive-Tables.pdf">
										The United Nations estimates that by 2020</a>, the number of people under the age of 5 will be
										outnumbered by those over 65.
									<a href="https://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/projections2004/en/">
										The World Health Organization projects</a> that rapid global aging will severely exacerbate the
									burden of noncommunicable diseases for populations who can least afford treatments.
									Therefore, humanity urgently needs to dramatically improve the prevention and treatment of these diseases,
									especially by developing <strong>soft, adaptive, and responsive biomaterials at a low cost</strong>
									for drugs or drug delivery vehicles with specific targeting mechanisms,
									environmentally sensitive implants for tissue engineering, or for dynamic health monitoring.</p>

									<p align="justify">We will achieve this vision through <strong>interdisciplinary studies of material and biological
									phenomena by advancing multiscale, multi-physics computational methods and simulations</strong>.
									We aim to characterize and predict the mechanical, chemical, optical, and electrical structure-function relationships
									of polymers, bio-polymers, and bio-inspired materials of various morphologies.
									With additional techniques from machine learning and computational biology, we investigate
									phenomena related to the human microbiome as a living material for engineering purposes.
									Through our research, we will propel the development of dynamically-responsive, living materials and
									design synthetic biological platforms for engineering and medical applications. </p>

										Prof. Jingjie Yeo is an assistant professor in Cornell University’s Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. He is the Principal Investigator at the J² Lab for Engineering Living Materials. The overarching goal of his research program is to lead advances in computationally designing and characterizing environmentally sustainable materials, with a focus on bacteria-based engineered living materials (ELMs) and the biopolymers that they produce. He is also a co-instructor in Station1, a social nonprofit organization dedicated to building the foundations of the university of the future through educational opportunity and socially-directed frontier STEM education, research, and internships. Prof. Jingjie Yeo is the recipient of multiple awards, including the NSF's most prestigious award, the NSF CAREER award, and the highest teaching award in Cornell's College of Engineering, the Dennis G. Shepherd Excellence in Teaching Award. Before joining Cornell University in 2020, Prof. Yeo was a research scientist in the Institute of High Performance Computing, Singapore where he helped develop cutting-edge, silk-based cosmeceuticals. Prior, he was a postdoc at both Tufts University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he developed and performed numerous multiscale simulations with density functional theory and fully-atomistic to coarse-grained molecular dynamics modeling on a broad variety of biomaterials such as squid skin, silk and silk-elastin-like proteins, and graphene. He received both his Ph.D. and his B.Eng. degrees from the School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering in Nanyang Technological University Singapore.</p>
