								<p align="justify">Our lab focuses on a single, complex issue: the rapid aging of the global human population.
									<a href="https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/trends/WPP2010/WPP2010_Volume-I_Comprehensive-Tables.pdf">
										The United Nations estimates that by 2020</a>, the number of people under the age of 5 will be
										outnumbered by those over 65.
									<a href="https://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/projections2004/en/">
										The World Health Organization projects</a> that rapid global aging will severely exacerbate the
									burden of noncommunicable diseases for populations who can least afford treatments.
									Therefore, humanity urgently needs to dramatically improve the prevention and treatment of these diseases,
									especially by developing <strong>soft, adaptive, and responsive biomaterials at a low cost</strong>
									for drugs or drug delivery vehicles with specific targeting mechanisms,
									environmentally sensitive implants for tissue engineering, or for dynamic health monitoring.</p>

									<p align="justify">We will achieve this vision through <strong>interdisciplinary studies of material and biological
									phenomena by advancing multiscale, multi-physics computational methods and simulations</strong>.
									We aim to characterize and predict the mechanical, chemical, optical, and electrical structure-function relationships
									of polymers, bio-polymers, and bio-inspired materials of various morphologies.
									With additional techniques from machine learning and computational biology, we investigate
									phenomena related to the human microbiome as a living material for engineering purposes.
									Through our research, we will propel the development of dynamically-responsive, living materials and
									design synthetic biological platforms for engineering and medical applications. </p>

									<p align="justify">Before joining Cornell University in 2020, Prof. Jingjie Yeo was a research scientist in the
										Institute of High Performance Computing, Singapore. As a co-PI, he worked on developing cutting-edge,
										silk-based cosmeceuticals. He also collaborated closely with Procter & Gamble for molecular dynamics (MD)
										modeling of keratins and pigment cells. Prior, he was a postdoc at both Tufts University and
										Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he developed and performed numerous multiscale simulations
										with density functional theory (DFT) and fully-atomistic to coarse-grained MD modeling on a broad variety of
										biomaterials such as squid skin, silk and silk-elastin-like proteins, and graphene. He is a co-instructor in
										<a href="https://www.station1.org">Station1</a>, a social nonprofit organization dedicated to building the foundations
